## üí° Key Concepts

### Stablecoin Yield Farming
- **USDC/USDT/DAI**: Stable cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar
- **Yield Farming**: Earning rewards by providing liquidity to DeFi protocols
- **Compound Interest**: Your earnings generate additional earnings over time
- **Auto-pay**: Automated bill payments using your stablecoin balance

### Risk Levels
- **Conservative (8% APY)**: Low-risk lending on established protocols like Aave
- **Moderate (10% APY)**: Medium-risk liquidity provision on DEXs
- **Aggressive (12% APY)**: Higher-risk multi-strategy yield farming

```css
:root {

}
```
